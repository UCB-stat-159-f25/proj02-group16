# Project 2: Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing

The goal of this project was to analyze US Presidents' State of the Union Addresses. The project helped to build a complete modern NLP workflow from the raw SOTU data into interpretable models. The contributors in this project loaded and cleaned the SOTU data, using spaCy to preprocess text and understand key concepts like tokens, lemmas, stop words, and punctuation. 

In Part 1 of the project, we explored the SOTU data by cleaning the dataset with pandas and creating visualizations or figures related to the Presidents and their speeches. In Part 2, we conducted simple text analyses by processing speeches with spaCy and getting a token and lemma list. We also created a function to return the most common words in SOTU speeches and used these findings to create heat maps and related graphs. In part 3, we conducted more advanced text processing by using LDA and BERtopic topic modelling.
